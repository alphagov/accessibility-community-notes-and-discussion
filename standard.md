# Accessibility Standard

This is a draft standard document. 

We want everyone to use our services. This is the right thing to do, and it is also the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents](law in the UK).

## Who should think about it?

We all need to think about accessibility. This includes:
* Product and project managers.
* Designers and UX designers.
* Developers.
* Content producers.

## How do we do it?

We use the [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/](Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0). WCAG 2.0 has three levels: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

Our services must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

## What do we need to do?

WCAG 2.0 has four themes. Content must be:
* Perceivable.
* Operable.
* Understandable.
* Robust.

There are things you need to do for each theme. Here is a short description of each one and the things you need to do.

### 1. Perceivable

Make sure people can recognise all information and content.
* Provide text alternatives for images.
* Provide transcripts for audio and video.
* Provide realtime captions for video.
* Make sure content is structured in a way that makes sense when it is read.
* Use the proper mark-up for every feature.
* Use text colours that show up clearly against the background colour.
* Make sure every feature can be used when text size is increased by 200%.
* Do not use images of text.

### Operable

Make sure people can use every feature of a service.
* Make sure everything works with a keyboard.
* Let people play/pause/stop moving content.
* Do not use blinking or flashing content.
* Provide a "skip to content" link.
* Provide helpful titles for pages and frames.
* Make sure keyboard users can move through content in a way that makes sense.
* Use link text that makes it easy to tell where the link goes.
* Make headings and labels helpful.
* Make it easy for keyboard users to see where they are in the content.

### Understandable

Make sure people can understand the content, and how the service works
* Use plain and simple language.
* Keep sentences short.
* Do not use words and phrases that people will not recognise, or provide an explanation if you cannot avoid it.
* Explain abbreviations and acronyms, unless you are very sure people will recognise them.
* Identify the language used for written content, and indicate when the written language changes.
* Make sure features look and behave in the same way every time they are used.
* Do not make big changes to content without people being aware of it.
* Provide instructions to help people use unfamiliar features.
* Make sure all form fields have visible and helpful labels.
* Make it easy for people to correct errors in forms.

### Robust

Make sure services can be used on different platforms and with different technologies
* Use proper code and make sure it is valid.
* Make sure the name, role and state of every feature can be identified.
